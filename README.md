# Git Introduction

An introduction of git, what it is, why use git, how it works, and.. a demo
project you can try, surely, on your own.

## Slides

I suggest you check out the slides __Versioning with Git__ [here](PITCHME.md).
The slide covers the theoritical background about Git. In fact, it's the only
reading in this repo.

## Requirements

Before you can try the demo project of using Git, of course, you need to have
Git installed in your machine. Here I have the links for you below:

- If you're using mac -> [download here](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
- If you're using windows -> [download here](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- If you're using Linux(Ubuntu), use below command

```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

To make sure you have installed Git, try this

```bash
git --version
```

Then, you are good to go.

## Demo Project

To be able to try the demo project on your own, first you need to clone this
repo to your workspace. You should know how to do it after you read and
understand what the slide explain.

Inside `demo-project` foler, you will find 3 demo files: `demo.cpp`, `demo.py`,
and `demo.m`. You will utilize these files for doing your demo project.

So, here what you need to try.

- Make sure you're in `demo-project`.
- Also, make sure that the folder is already a Git project. If it's not, initiate one.

```bash
git init
```

- Check it by using: `git status`.
- Then, open your favorite editor and open the `demo-project` folder.
- And.. tweak them! change the code, it's up to you, but make sure you still can run it, though.
