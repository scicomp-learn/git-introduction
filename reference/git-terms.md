# Git and Version Control Terminology

## 1. Working Directory

It's the files that we see in computer's file system. When working with Git,
Working Directory is different from the command line's concept of the _current working directory_ 
which is the directory that the shell is "looking at".

## 2. Checkout

__Checkout__ is when content in the repository has been __copied__ to the Working Directory.

## 3. Staging Area / Staging Index / Index

A file in the Git directory that stores information about what will go into the next commit.
Think of it as a prep table where Git will take the next commit.

## 4. SHA

It's basically an ID number for each commit. for example: `e2adf8ae3e2e4ed40add75cc44cf9d0a869afeb6`.
It's shorthand for _Secure Hash ALgorithm_.

## 5. Branch

__Branch__ is when a new line of development is created that diverges from the
main line of develoment without altering the main line.
